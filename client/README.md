# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

New Ideas - 
That's a great project idea! Here are some unique component ideas for your Tailwind React library:

1. **Animated List Reordering**: A draggable list component with smooth animations to reorder items, using Tailwind for styling. This would be useful for todo lists or priority management apps.

2. **Dynamic Bento Grid**: A grid layout where items can change sizes based on content or screen width, with options for hover and scroll-triggered animations, ideal for portfolio or gallery displays.

3. **Customizable Steps Timeline**: A step-by-step timeline component that can handle vertical or horizontal layouts. Include options for custom icons, animations, and Tailwind-based themes.

4. **Radial Menu**: A circular menu component that expands when clicked or hovered, with options for icons and text in each radial segment. It’s visually unique and great for interactive dashboards.

5. **Swipeable Notification Banners**: Notification banners that users can swipe away. This could include various types (info, warning, error) and Tailwind-based transitions for smooth swipe animations.

6. **Gradient Border Cards**: Card components with gradient borders and hover effects. These could be used for profiles, media items, or general information, adding a modern, colorful look to cards.

7. **Scroll-Synced Image Carousel**: A carousel that updates images based on scroll position rather than clicks, perfect for storytelling or product showcases. Tailwind’s flexibility with responsive styles would make it highly customizable.

8. **Data Table with Dynamic Filters**: A data table that includes built-in filters for searching and sorting data, with animations for adding/removing filters. Tailwind can handle the table styling and filter controls.

9. **Interactive Map Markers**: A map marker component that can show additional information in popups. You could integrate these with Tailwind for a stylized info display on hover or click.

10. **Responsive Side Panel Drawer**: A side panel that can slide in/out, suitable for sidebars or additional info panels. Include a toggle button with animated transitions, adaptable to screens of different sizes.

11. **Split Pane Resizer**: A component that allows users to resize two adjacent panes (like text and preview) with a draggable resizer. This would be great for editing interfaces.

12. **Timeline with Milestone Animations**: A horizontally or vertically scrollable timeline that reveals animations at each milestone, ideal for history, project milestones, or educational content.

13. **Tag Input with Autocomplete**: An input component for adding tags or keywords, with a dropdown autocomplete that appears as the user types, using Tailwind styling for smooth integration.

14. **Rich Tooltips with Images**: Tooltips that can handle not just text but also images, icons, and action buttons. Perfect for tutorials, help icons, or product previews.

15. **Customizable Voting Cards**: Like upvote/downvote systems, with animated counters and emoji-based reactions. This could work well for feedback or rating systems on websites.

16. **Contextual Menu with Custom Actions**: A context menu component that displays additional actions when users right-click on specific elements. Include animations for menu items and options for custom styling.

17. **Progress Circle with Checkpoints**: A circular progress indicator where you can add checkpoints that reveal information or tooltips at certain stages, like step-by-step progress or achievements.

18. **Code Snippet with Copy Button and Syntax Highlighting**: A pre-styled code snippet component with a built-in copy button and support for syntax highlighting, using Tailwind’s color schemes.

19. **Interactive Storybook Grid**: A grid that displays images or cards in a sequence, revealing content as users click or hover, ideal for storytelling, portfolios, or case studies.

20. **Accordion with Icon Animation**: An accordion component where icons (such as + or -) animate in sync with the opening and closing of sections, adding a smooth, polished feel.

Each of these components could be built with modularity and configurability in mind, allowing users to customize them to fit their designs effortlessly.
